# Detailed Summary
In this project, we developed data visualization dashboard to analyze the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which contains information on the microbial species found in human navels. 

Utilizing the D3.js library, we processed JSON data from a given URL and implemented a dropdown menu for user interaction. We leveraged Plotly.js to construct various visualizations, including a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs per sample, a bubble chart representing the entire dataset, and a gauge chart representing washes-per-week per test subject. We augmented the dashboard by presenting individual demographic metadata in a dedicated "Demographic Info" panel. The user interface triggered real-time updates of all visualizations upon selecting a new sample, ensuring responsiveness and interactivity.

Our analysis indicated that a limited number of microbial species, referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were present in more than 70% of the population, with other species being relatively rare.
